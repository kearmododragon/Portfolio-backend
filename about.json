    "bio": "Hello! Welcome to my portfolio. Below you will have access to my previous work, all completed while studying at General Assembley. I currently work for Mercedes-Benz as a Logistics Specialist however I want to follow my passion and am looking to take a leap into the world of Software Engineering. I have a dog named Soba and she takes up most of my life now. She's a black Galgo and I love her to pieces. I play football in my spare time and when i'm feeling less active like to relax by playing video games, original I know. <br> Ciaran Kearney graduated from General Assembley with a qualification in May 2023. He enjoys working in full-stack developments and looks forward to improving his skills in order to both excell at his chosen career and also to be able to work on passion projects.",
